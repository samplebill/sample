Loan Transitions ... approve etc - possible done CHECK AFTER
    if  "eventLocalDate" parameter added with string date then instead of parameter not supported msg do get jackson conversion exception. -
"JsonMappingException: Invalid format: &quot;07 June 2012&quot; " KW might do jackson conversion exception to json.

    approve loan (already closed) with approval date before submitted date - now fine and shows json msg but
    if approve loan (already closed) with approval date after submitted date - DataIntegrityViolationException: Column 'loan_status_id' cannot be null;


describe waiver CHECK RULES AFTER - good but maybe there should be an amount pass in ? it let me waive 12 when there was only 10 left...

when creating loan: if arrearsTolerance left there is an exception - for the other mandatory fields... just a json msg saying it is mandatory (OK).






BUT NOT FOR NOWS
should be able to get clients by branch as well
also get loans of different status's by branch etc
list of loan transactions not available (except in summary - presume repayments section has repayments and waivers and adjusts)
